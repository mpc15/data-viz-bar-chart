# Data Visualization - Bar Graph
##### _A simple bar graph visualizing U.S. GDP from 1947 to 2015_
***

This is the repo for a bar graph I built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5. The goal was to clearly visualize overall GDP growth in the United States from 1947 to 2015, and display individual data points when a user hovers over it.
